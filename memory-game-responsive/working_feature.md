The updated code has the game board fit within the fruit boarder and is responsive to changing window sizes. One of the things I changed was I was getting the game board to fit within the fruit boarder before hitting start game but after pressing start game, the game board would be messed up. I had to go into the JavaScript file and delete the lines in the generateFruitBoarder function that said: gameContainer.style.width = "min(80vw, 600px)"; gameContainer.style.top = "calc(50% + 20px)"; because these lines of code were overriding changes made in the css file about the size of the game boarder after the game had started. The game container was changed to having fixed positions with the margins at 60px so that it stays inside the fruit boarder while also enabiling scrolling for overflow. The borderPadding of the fruit boarder was updated so that it no longer overlapped the game board. The cards in the game now switch between a 4x4 and an 8x2 layout depending on the size of the screen.
